          <div class="article" title="I Ching">
              
              <h2><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160512184105/http://www.uncarved.com/articles/ching">I Ching</a></h2>
              
              <div class="precis">About the hexagrams on this site</div>
              <p>My interest in the I Ching began when I was a music student.  Studing John Cage, I learned that he was heavily influenced by the I Ching and used hexagrams as an aid to composition of aleatoric music.  I bought a copy of the Richard Wilhelm translation and learned to cast hexagrams via the coin oracle.  I revived this interest when I studied Tai Chi Chuan.</p>
<p>Every visitor to the front page of this website is greeted by a pair of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160512184105/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_ching">I-Ching</a> hexagrams, which are generated by <a href="/web/20160512184105/http://www.uncarved.com/static/ching.py.txt">this</a> small python program.  The distribution of results in the I-Ching is not uniform, and this page gives the same distribution of lines as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160512184105/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching_divination#Yarrow_stalks">Yarrow Stalk oracle</a>.  The second hexagram is the first but with "moving lines" inverted in the traditional fashion.  This website uses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160512184105/http://webpy.org/">web.py</a>, and I incorporate the I-Ching reading into the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160512184105/http://cheetahtemplate.org/">Cheetah</a> template for the homepage.  The relevant snippet of template code looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>            #import ching
            #set $hexes = $ching.get_hexagram_pair
            #set $hex1 = int($ching.get_hexagram_number($hexes[0]))
            #set $hex2 = int($ching.get_hexagram_number($hexes[1]))
            #set $name1 = $ching.get_hexagram_name($hexes[0])
            #set $name2 = $ching.get_hexagram_name($hexes[1])
            #echo '&lt;img id="hex1" alt="%d: %s" src="/static/images/iching/Iching-hexagram-%02d.png" /&gt;' % (hex1,name1 ,hex1) #
            #echo '&lt;img id="hex2" alt="%d: %s" src="/static/images/iching/Iching-hexagram-%02d.png" /&gt;' % (hex2,name2 ,hex2) #
</code></pre>
<p>...and the lovely hexagram graphics are in the public domain.  I downloaded them from the wikipedia.</p>

              <p>This server is a co-located Linux box, and is brought to me (and you) courtesy of the excellent folks at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160512184105/http://www.mythic-beasts.com/" title="A great colo company who know what they're talking about">mythic-beasts.com</a>. Their service has been exemplary so far so I would recommend them if you want cheap tech-savvy colo or virtual serving. This server runs excellent free Linux server software such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160512184105/http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html" title="A dns system that's nothing like BIND">djbdns</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160512184105/http://www.qmail.org/" title="small, fast, secure mail server">qmail</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160512184105/http://www.lighttpd.net/" title="small, fast web server">lighttpd</a>.

If I tidy the script up enough for general consumption I'll make it available.</p>
<p>The server also runs some free software of my own, such as <a href="/web/20160512184105/http://www.uncarved.com/static/slidentd/" title="secure lightweight ident daemon">slidentd</a>. I have been told that if Britney Spears wanted an ident daemon, this is one of a long list she would ignore before just switching on the pidentd that came with her Linux distro.

              <div class="precis">The name of this website has a specific meaning that derives from Taoism</div>
              <p>The Uncarved Block is a common English translation of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160512184105/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism" title="Wikipedia article on Taoism">Taoist</a> concept called "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160512184105/http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/taoism/#pu" title="simplicity">pu</a>". A block of wood that is not yet carved has no set form, it is thus infinite in potential and free from desire.</p>

              <p>I trained to postgraduate level as a Jazz bass player, but worked as a programmer to pay for my music postgrad and somehow ended up in a career in computer science.  After various roles as a permanent employee and contractor I became the IT director of a dot com company.  I recently left my job working for Goldman Sachs and am doing a number of interesting side projects and a bit of IT contracting.  If you have a proposal to make to me feel free to email me at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160512184105/mailto:sean@uncarved.com">&#115;&#101;&#97;&#110;&#64;&#117;&#110;&#99;&#97;&#114;&#118;&#101;&#100;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>.</p>
