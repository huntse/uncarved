            <div class="precis">Unix provides fine-grained access control for files. It&#39;s important to understand it.</div>
            

            <h4>What unix file permissions are</h4>
<p>At their most basic, unix file permissions are a set of bits which control who has the permission to read from, write to and execute files. They have similar, but slightly different meanings as applied to directories. The mode is normally expressed either as a symbolic string of gibberish or as a numeric mode.</p>
<h4>Numeric file permissions</h4>
<p>A numeric mode is normally expressed as set of three or four octal digits but can be any length up to four. Any ommitted digits are assumed to be leading zeroes. The first digit is the sum of the "set uid" (4), "set gid" (2), and "sticky" (1) attributes. If you need these you know what they mean. Otherwise, move along please. The second digit sets permissions for the owner of the file to read(4), write(2), and execute(1) the file. The third sets permissions for members of the group specified as the group owner of the file and the fourth for people not in the file's group, with the same values for read, write and execute as the user permission digit. You figure out what permissions you need by adding the bits together. If I want a file to be readable and writeable by me and its group and just readable by others, I might run chmod 664 file to change the mode of the file.</p>
<h4>Symbolic file permissions</h4>
<p>commands which deal with file permissions often allow you to specify symbolic permissions as follows:
    u   user
    g   group
    o   other
    r   read
    w   write
    x   execute
    +   add specified permission
    -   remove specified permission
    =   make permission exactly equal to this</p>
<p>So in the example above, I could achieve the results I wanted by chmod ug=rw,o=r file or by looking at the current file mode and using "+" or "-" as appropriate. For example, to remove group and world write and execute permissions on a file I might do chmod go-wx file. See the man chmod for more details. On linux boxes you may have to do info chmod to get all the details because the GNU project don't like manual pages.</p>
<h4>Finding out file permissions</h4>
<p>You can see a symbolic representation of the permissions on a file or directory by using ls -l. If you want to understand why files you create get the permissions they do, read about how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160512184119/http://www.uncarved.com/blog/umasks.mrk">umasks</a> work.</p>
<h4>Special file permissions</h4>
<p>I said "move along please", but to reward you for your persistence, these are the meanings of the leftmost digit of four-digit octal file permissions. Note: Do not use these unless you really know what you are doing. The setuid and setgid bits on files in particular have been responsible for many serious security breaches when thoughtlessly applied to unworthy programs.</p>
<p>When set on files:</p>
<pre><code>Numeric Symbolic    Name    Meaning
4000    u+s setuid bit  If the file is executed, set the effective user id of the resultant process to the owner of the file.
2000    g+s setgid bit  If the file is executed, set the effective group id of the resultant process to the group owner of the file.
1000    t   sticky bit  No effect. On ancient systems it means "Save the text image of the program to swap to speed up load time".
</code></pre>
<p>When applied to directories, the meanings of these bits are subtly different and more system- and filesystem-dependent:</p>
<pre><code>Numeric Symbolic    Name    Meaning
4000    u+s setuid bit  No effect
2000    g+s setgid bit  Set the group owner of files created in this directory to the group of the group owner of the directory instead of the primary group of the file's creator
1000    t   sticky bit or "restricted delete flag"  On some systems it means prevent users from removing or renaming files in this directory unless they own the file or directory
</code></pre>
