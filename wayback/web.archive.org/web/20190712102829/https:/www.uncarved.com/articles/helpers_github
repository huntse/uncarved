            <p>To share the marketmaking software that I talked about in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160512184033/http://www.uncarved.com/blog/mm_1.mrk" title="The first article in my electronic marketmaking series">first marketmaking article</a>, we need to have a repository set up, so I decided to get going with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160512184033/http://github.com/" title="Github - a public git repository">github</a>.  You'll need to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160512184033/http://help.github.com/set-up-git-redirect" title="Instructions to set up the git version control system">set up git</a>, and you'll need <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160512184033/http://maven.apache.org/">maven 2</a> to build everything.  I thought I'd put out a small article to get people started with building a small package we're going to depend on for the bigger system.  Assuming this goes ok, I'll push the actual software that interfaces with bullionvault.</p>
<p>Once you've got git and maven2 set up, it should be simple enough.  On my linux boxes I just do:</p>
<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/huntse/helpers.git
cd helpers
mvn test
</code></pre>
<p>...and with any luck, git will get the software, maven2 will download the internet and some time later build and run the tests, and you'll see something like this:  </p>
