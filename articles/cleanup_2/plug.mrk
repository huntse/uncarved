# A blatant plug

## A concert worth attending (not that I have any personal interest. Oh
no...)

On Thursday 7 June [The][5] Flautadors will be playing a concert at
[Wigmore][6] Hall, one of the best venues for chamber music in London.
The concert is to launch their new CD of Baroque music by Purcell and
Locke, and it should be a great. You can [book][7] for the concert
[now.][8]

I have to declare an interest, because Catherine Fleming, one of
members of The Flautadors, is my wife. I also host their mail and dns
and translated their website from a table-based layout to xhtml and
css.
