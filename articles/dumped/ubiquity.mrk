Mozilla Ubiquity

   Fun with this amazing mozilla addon

   [5]Ubiquity is an amazing mozilla addon which gives users a
   command-line interface within the browser which you can use to do
   various things. Users can easily write their own commands in javascript
   and share them via the web. In that spirit, I've written my first
   ubiquity command, which searches hoogle, the haskell type-aware search
   engine.
CmdUtils.makeSearchCommand({
  homepage: "http://www.uncarved.com/",
  author: { name: "Sean Hunter"},
  license: "MPL",
  name: "hoogle-search",
  url: "http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/?hoogle={QUERY}",
  icon: "http://www.haskell.org/favicon.ico",
  description: "Searches haskell.org for functions matching by name or type sign
ature.",
});

   As you can see, it's virtually all meta-data and that's because there
   are a bunch of functions around search that know how to do everything
   you need to do. However, you can write more sophisticated commands that
   manipulate the browser, the web page you're on, have little built-in
   previews etc. All very nifty.

   When you have the above, you can simply invoke ubiquity and say
   "hoogle-search Ord a => a -> a" or whatever and it will find you
   functions matching that type signature. I'll share this command (and
   any others I write) at [6]www.uncarved.com using the subscription
   mechanism they recommend.

   I was feeling rather proud of the above, however I saw this morning
   that if you go on a page with a search box, select it and invoke
   ubiquity and type "create-new-search-command" it writes something very
   much like the above for you.
