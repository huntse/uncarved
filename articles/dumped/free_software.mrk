Free Software

   A Small Collection of Free Software I have written
     * [5]slidentd - the sly ident daemon
     * [6]honest_identd - The slidentd package also includes this if you
       want a simple identd that gives up usernames
     * [7]aed - The additional entropy daemon
     * [8]sw - A tiny ssl wrapper (similar to stunnel). I use it to
       provide ssl-enabled services.
     * [9]dnslogmunge - A small perl script for decoding djbjdns logfiles
     * [10]unaligned.c - A small wrapper for debugging unaligned traps on
       risc machines. Used by folks at compaq (when they produced Alphas)
       and some linux folks at IBM. In fact I gave IBM a slightly better
       version of this but I can't find it at the minute.
     * [11]ching.py - A small python module which can be used to generate
       hexagrams of the I Ching
     * [12]uncarved-helpers - A collection of scala classes, including a
       nice web client, a log4j thingymabobber and a memoization
       watchamacallit.
