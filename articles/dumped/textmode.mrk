Using a Linux laptop in text mode

   Linux has everything you need to use your laptop even if you choose not
   to use the pointy-clicky interfaces

   So having recently got a [5]netbook, I have been learning how to do
   everything on it. It's obviously all easy if you use something like
   [6]xfce or [7]gnome, or some netbook-specific spin like the [8]Ubuntu
   netbook remix, but I like to use [9]xmonad, so it helps to learn how to
   do all the laptoppy things in text mode.

   Here's a list of things it's useful to know:
     * nm-applet - finds a network and connects to it automagically
     * pm-suspend - sends your laptop into a light sleep
     * pm-hibernate - sends your laptop into a heavy sleep where it uses
       no battery
