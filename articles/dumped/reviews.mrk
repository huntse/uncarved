Undercover Economist

   A review of "The Undercover Economist" by Tim Harford

   Inspired by my friend [5]Erich Schlaikjer, I intend to write some
   reviews of books and music and put them up here, so I'll start with the
   book I have just finished, which is "The Undercover Economist" by
   [6]Tim Harford.

   This book is an entertaining and thought-provoking exposition of some
   key principles of economics and how they interact with big questions
   (such as "Why are rich companies rich and poor companies poor?"), small
   questions (such as "Why does my morning coffee cost as much as it
   does?") and all sizes in between. In that respect, it grows out of the
   author's "Dear Economist" column in the weekend [7]ft, in which he
   offers often amusing "agony-aunt" style advice using the principles of
   economics to shine a light into normal everyday activities and moral
   dilemmas. The same mix of clear, reasoned argument and amusing and
   thought-provoking style is in evidence in this book.

   All of the economics is explained and argued in a way that someone
   (such as myself) who has interest but little understanding in this
   field can easily follow, and there are references at the back to
   academic papers and journalism that back up the author's points and
   provide a starting-point for additional reading.

   As another entry in the growing field of "popular economics" books, and
   with it's ostensibly similar promise of using economics to shine a new
   light onto everyday things this book is bound to provoke comparisons
   with "[8]Freakonomics", but both books are worth reading in their own
   right and there is very little that is covered in both. Actually I
   enjoyed "The Undercover Economist" more, not least because it lacked
   the selfcongratulatory sections of Freakonomics that annoyed me so.
   (That book has sections that are just one of the authors telling you
   how clever and amazing the other author is- I don't want someone to
   tell me they are clever, I want them to show me!). It is also more
   deeply thought-provoking for being less willfully controversial.
