   People and stuff that have made this website fun to produce

   This server is a co-located Linux box, and is brought to me (and you)
   courtesy of the excellent folks at [5]mythic-beasts.com. Their service
   has been exemplary so far so I would recommend them if you want cheap
   tech-savvy colo or virtual serving. This server runs excellent free
   Linux server software such as [6]djbdns, [7]qmail, and [8]lighttpd.
   Dynamic content is produced by a [9]python script I wrote using
   [10]web.py . If I tidy the script up enough for general consumption
   I'll make it available.

   The server also runs some free software of my own, such as
   [11]slidentd. I have been told that if Britney Spears wanted an ident
   daemon, this is one of a long list she would ignore before just
   switching on the pidentd that came with her Linux distro. My pages are
   written using the [12]vim editor, and I use a [13]typematrix dvorak
   keyboard.
