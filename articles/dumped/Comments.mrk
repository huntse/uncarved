Adding comments

   So I've thought about doing this for some time but never had the spare
   time. Finally I add comments.

   I have added comments for the first time. I don't expect there will be
   a great deal of traffic and at the moment just to get started I have
   moderation on. If things seem to be resonably calm and the wingnuts
   stay away, I'll turn moderation off.

   I'm using the comment system from [5]intense debate, which has been
   fantastically easy to set up and use so far. Let me know what you
   think.
