My Biog

   Some stuff about me

   I trained to postgraduate level as a Jazz bass player, but worked as a
   programmer to pay for my music postgrad and somehow ended up in a
   career in computer science. After various roles as a permanent employee
   and contractor I became the IT director of a dot com company. I
   recently left my job working for Goldman Sachs and am doing a number of
   interesting side projects and a bit of IT contracting. If you have a
   proposal to make to me feel free to email me at [5]sean@uncarved.com.

   You can see [6]my linkedin profile, and invite me to your network if we
   know each other. There are quite a few Sean Hunters though so I might
   not be the one you're thinking of.
