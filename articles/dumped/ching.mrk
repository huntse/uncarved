I Ching

   About the hexagrams on this site

   My interest in the I Ching began when I was a music student. Studing
   John Cage, I learned that he was heavily influenced by the I Ching and
   used hexagrams as an aid to composition of aleatoric music. I bought a
   copy of the Richard Wilhelm translation and learned to cast hexagrams
   via the coin oracle. I revived this interest when I studied Tai Chi
   Chuan.

   Every visitor to the front page of this website is greeted by a pair of
   [5]I-Ching hexagrams, which are generated by [6]this small python
   program. The distribution of results in the I-Ching is not uniform, and
   this page gives the same distribution of lines as the [7]Yarrow Stalk
   oracle. The second hexagram is the first but with "moving lines"
   inverted in the traditional fashion. This website uses [8]web.py, and I
   incorporate the I-Ching reading into the [9]Cheetah template for the
   homepage. The relevant snippet of template code looks like this:
            #import ching
            #set $hexes = $ching.get_hexagram_pair
            #set $hex1 = int($ching.get_hexagram_number($hexes[0]))
            #set $hex2 = int($ching.get_hexagram_number($hexes[1]))
            #set $name1 = $ching.get_hexagram_name($hexes[0])
            #set $name2 = $ching.get_hexagram_name($hexes[1])
            #echo '<img id="hex1" alt="%d: %s" src="/static/images/iching/Iching
-hexagram-%02d.png" />' % (hex1,name1 ,hex1) #
            #echo '<img id="hex2" alt="%d: %s" src="/static/images/iching/Iching
-hexagram-%02d.png" />' % (hex2,name2 ,hex2) #

   ...and the lovely hexagram graphics are in the public domain. I
   downloaded them from the wikipedia.
