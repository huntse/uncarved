Why Uncarved?

   The name of this website has a specific meaning that derives from
   Taoism

   The Uncarved Block is a common English translation of a [5]Taoist
   concept called "[6]pu". A block of wood that is not yet carved has no
   set form, it is thus infinite in potential and free from desire.
