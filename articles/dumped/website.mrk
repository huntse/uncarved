Website Changes

   An occasionally-updated summary of stuff I've changed

   So when I had a day off work this week I decided to fix a few things on
   this site that have been bugging me for a while:
     * most of the content is dynamic, yet the [5]sitemap (used by search
       engines to figure out how to slurp your site) was not
     * I never bothered to put proper [6]meta description tags on pages
     * now that there were quite a few articles things were getting lost
       in painful navigation
     * The site didn't do gzip encoding
     * I've finally added comments thanks to [7]intense debate

   So I've had a go at fixing them. I now generate my sitemaps
   automatically using the code I wrote to generate the atom and rss
   feeds, transparently gzip stuff if your client can accept that, and
   there is a new "[8]treeview" page on the side to make things easier to
   get to. Oh, and the pages have proper description tags which should
   make them more useful on search engines.

   Hope this all helps.
