Shell Command History and Searching

   Time spent learning how the unix shell works is never wasted

   One of the easiest ways to improve your productivity on unix systems is
   to become acquainted with your shell's history completion and search
   facilities. All of these described here are common to zsh and bash,
   although zsh has some additional features that bash does not.

   Firstly, if you ever find yourself tapping the up arrow to scroll
   through your command history, you are living in a state of sin- either
   type history 100 or something similar to actually get a history list or
   use Ctrl-R to do a recursive incremental search through your shell
   history. Secondly, learn and use some basic history completions:
     * !$ completes to the last argument of your previous command. vi file
       followed by cvs ci !$ edits a file and checks it in.
     * !* completes to all the arguments of your previous command. vi
       file1 file2 file{3,4,5} followed by cvs ci !* edits a list of files
       and checks then all in.
     * !! completes to the whole of your previous command, with args. vi
       /etc/passwd gives "permission denied? Use sudo !! to become rootly
       without retyping.

   There are lots more possible history completions but I use those three
   ten times for any one of them. Also useful are:
     * !something completes to the whole of the last command I typed that
       began with "something". So, for example, say I try vi file and get
       "permission denied", but I don't yet have "sudo" permission sorted
       out. I become root, fix my sudoers file, then do sudo !vi to run
       the whole of the last vi command as root.
     * !somenumber completes to the whole of a specific numbered command
       from my history.

   You can combine these with the first three constructs by adding a
   colon, so:
     * !vi:* is "all the arguments to the last vi command. Perhaps I have
       edited some files, then done a make to see if they build, then I
       can svn ci !vi:* to check the changes into subversion.
     * !3:$ is the last argument to command number three from my history.
