Getting Things Done in Text with notation3

   I want a simple means of tracking and grouping tasks that works in text
   form and is easily parseable. And I want to learn notation3 too...

   Inspired by [5]this article on lifehacker I decided to make my own
   "getting things done" toolset. It would ideally need to be just as
   flexible from the commandline as the lifehack "todo.txt" file but have
   machine readablility too. I have decided to use [6]notation3 as the
   basic format. n3 is useful because it is a machine-parseable format
   that is easily converted into xml, but it's not as tedious to write as
   xml can often be. So far it looks as if I will be able to make a "one
   line per item" file that meets all of the "getting things done in txt"
   requirements but will also be able to be used online and via the
   semantic web toolset. I will be updating this article as I go along,
   not least because n3 is entirely new to me and I am bound to change
   things as I go along.

   So far, the document looks something like this:
@prefix : <#> .
:tidy_garden :contexts "@home" ; :next_action "Mow lawn" ; :all_actions "Mow law
n" , "Weed borders" , "Turn compost" , "Prune" , "Tidy front garden" ; :priority
 2 .
:sort_finances :contexts "@home" , "@work" ; :next_action "Consolidate pensions"
 ; :all_actions "Consolidate pensions" , "ebay junk", "make budget" ; :priority
1 .

   As you can see, for each item, I can list the contexts in which it can
   take place, the next action and all the actions I have thought of for
   that item so far. For the next actions at the moment I am just using
   string literals, but I will soon change those into ":" labels so I can
   join the tasks together in a graph and have some tasks dependant on
   others. In n3 you can make rules and draw inferences so I could have it
   figure out for me what I should be doing next. Since the output is
   [7]rdf I could make a full ontology for tasks etc and then as well as
   having a tool for humans, I would have a machine-readable format for
   this stuff that would fit into the [8]semantic web. I may do that.

   To get going with notation3, you need a computer with [9]python and you
   need to install [10]rdflib and [11]cwm. It's well worth the effort to
   do this.
