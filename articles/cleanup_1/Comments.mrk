# Adding comments

## So I've thought about doing this for some time but never had the spare
time. Finally I add comments.

I have added comments for the first time. I don't expect there will be
a great deal of traffic and at the moment just to get started I have
moderation on. If things seem to be resonably calm and the wingnuts
stay away, I'll turn moderation off.

I'm using the comment system from [5]intense debate, which has been
fantastically easy to set up and use so far. Let me know what you
think.
