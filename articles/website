            <p>So when I had a day off work this week I decided to fix a few things on this site that have been bugging me for a while:</p>
<ul>
<li>most of the content is dynamic, yet the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160512184006/http://www.sitemaps.org/" title="Home of the sitemaps protocol">sitemap</a> (used by search engines to figure out how to slurp your site) was not</li>
<li>I never bothered to put proper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160512184006/http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=35264&amp;hl=en#1" title="google's view of how to make good page description tags">meta description tags</a> on pages</li>
<li>now that there were quite a few articles things were getting lost in painful navigation</li>
<li>The site didn't do gzip encoding</li>
<li>I've finally added comments thanks to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160512184006/http://intensedebate.com/" title="Third-party ajax comments thingummybobber">intense debate</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So I've had a go at fixing them.  I now generate my sitemaps automatically using the code I wrote to generate the atom and rss feeds, transparently gzip stuff if your client can accept that, and there is a new "<a href="/web/20160512184006/http://www.uncarved.com/treeview/">treeview</a>" page on the side to make things easier to get to.  Oh, and the pages have proper description tags which should make them more useful on search engines.  </p>
<p>Hope this all helps.</p>
