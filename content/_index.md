# The Uncarved Block

Please bear with me while I restore my content. At the height of the covid
crisis I missed some emails from my cloud provider which said they were trying
to bill me on an expired credit card.  As a consequence they deleted my server
and my backups.

In an unrelated catastrophe my "offsite" backup is on a computer that was bricked
and that I can't get repaired until the lockdown is over.

I am restoring everything at the moment and the journey to get my content back
has been an interesting unix exercise which I hope to document once it's all
fully back up and running.

Since the source code to my blog (yes I wrote it myself) seems to have been
irretrievably lost, I am taking the opportunity to move to using a static site
generator ([zola](https://www.getzola.org)) and host on a different provider.
Most of my actual content has now been recovered although the presentation will
be even more minimalist than usual while I figure out how to get zola to do
everything I want.
