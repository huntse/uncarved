At the moment I'm aware of:
- A few formatting problems and broken links remain
* no I-Ching hexagrams (yet).  I know how to add them even though this is now a
  static site
- A bunch of static content including most archives of my open source software are gone
  probably permanently
- I have turned off RSS2 feeds (:sob:) so atom is your only option if you're
  still doing the feed thing
