# Changing to a kinesis keyboard

## I thought I would never find a keyboard that I liked better than
Typematrix, but I may have to eat my words...

Until yesterday, I used to use a [typematrix][5] [6]dvorak keyboard.
Typematrix is a fabulous keyboard with lots of terrific design features
but its primary strength is that it has a small desktop footprint, and
that it uses straight forward and back movements of the fingers without
any of the small left and right movements that are required due to the
staggered layouts of conventional keyboards. This is a massive
improvement if you do a lot of typing or if you have problems with your
hands and wrists.

The one weakness of the typematrix in my opinion is that the modifier
keys (ctrl and alt) are not placed in a very convenient spot. This used
not to bother me as I am a Vim user and so didn't require lots of
control keystrokes. However, recently I have been doing almost all of
my programming in a proprietary in-house environment and this has been
causing my pinkies to take more and more of the strain. I finally
decided to make the switch when I had a marathon coding day where I
wrote something like 600 lines of very formulaic code in a day and my
fingers were aching from the funny contortions I had been putting them
through with all of the control keystrokes that had been required.

I briefly tried out one of my colleagues [kinesis][7] "Advantage"
keyboards and immediately decided that it was weird enough that I
should buy one. I opted for a model that has an inbuilt hardware dvorak
mode. I prefer this so that I am able to use dvorak mode right from the
login, rather than switching in user preferences or dotfiles.

So, the kinesis keyboard feels like a substantial unit. When you are
typing on it, it has a pleasing clackiness, and the general
functionality is good. It has a very cool hardware remapping thing that
means you can move the keys you don't like around to your heart's
content. It's a really nice keyboard.
