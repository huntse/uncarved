So having recently got a [netbook,][5] I have been learning how to do
everything on it. It's obviously all easy if you use something like
[xfce][6] or [7]gnome, or some netbook-specific spin like the [8]Ubuntu
netbook remix, but I like to use [xmonad,][9] so it helps to learn how to
do all the laptoppy things in text mode.

Here's a list of things it's useful to know:
* `nm-applet` - finds a network and connects to it automagically
* `pm-suspend` - sends your laptop into a light sleep
* `pm-hibernate` - sends your laptop into a heavy sleep where it uses
no battery
