My interest in the I Ching began when I was a music student. Studing
John Cage, I learned that he was heavily influenced by the I Ching and
used hexagrams as an aid to composition of aleatoric music. I bought a
copy of the Richard Wilhelm translation and learned to cast hexagrams
via the coin oracle. I revived this interest when I studied Tai Chi
Chuan.

Every visitor to the front page of this website is greeted by a pair of
[I-Ching][5] hexagrams, which are generated by [this][6] small python
program. The distribution of results in the I-Ching is not uniform, and
this page gives the same distribution of lines as the [Yarrow][7] Stalk
oracle. The second hexagram is the first but with "moving lines"
inverted in the traditional fashion. This website uses [web.py,][8] and I
incorporate the I-Ching reading into the [Cheetah][9] template for the
homepage. The relevant snippet of template code looks like this:

    #import ching
    #set $hexes = $ching.get_hexagram_pair
    #set $hex1 = int($ching.get_hexagram_number($hexes[))][0]
    #set $hex2 = int($ching.get_hexagram_number($hexes[))][1]
    #set $name1 = $ching.get_hexagram_name($hexes[)][0]
    #set $name2 = $ching.get_hexagram_name($hexes[)][1]
    #echo '<img id="hex1" alt="%d: %s" src="/static/images/iching/Iching
    -hexagram-%02d.png" />' % (hex1,name1 ,hex1) #
    #echo '<img id="hex2" alt="%d: %s" src="/static/images/iching/Iching
    -hexagram-%02d.png" />' % (hex2,name2 ,hex2) #

...and the lovely hexagram graphics are in the public domain. I
downloaded them from the wikipedia.
