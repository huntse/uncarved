# Public funding of political parties

## The UK political parties are voting for their own interests by asking for taxpayer funding. Taxpayers should say "no".

In the light of recent scandals various proposals have been made that
would result in political parties in the UK receiving taxpayers' money
to fund their activities. This is something that UK taxpayers should
fight in the strongest possible terms for two reasons: Firstly, the
main political parties stand to benefit hugely from this change- they
would no longer need to worry about funding but would simply receive
boatloads of cash as of right. This would tend to entrench the
political status quo. Secondly, it could only be achieved by raising
the tax burden in the UK even higher than it is now or by cutting
government expenditure on other things. As all taxes promote economic
inefficiency raising the tax burden is a terrible idea. Equally, while
cutting government expenditure in general is a good thing, simply
replacing one existing form of government waste with another is bad in
general and in this case particularly odious.

How about instead we keep our current system where people who want
political parties to be well-funded get to put their money where their
mouth is and fund them? This is good for several reasons: Firstly it is
maximally efficient- I spend the amount I want to spend to achieve the
political funding outcome I want and nothing is wasted. Secondly, I
can't lie- if political funding is so important to me that I want
others to pay but I am unwilling to pay myself I get nothing. Thirdly,
people who are not interested in sponsoring a political party are not
forced against their will to do so. Finally, the overall burden of
taxation is not increased, so everyone has more money of their own
which they can use to do whatever they want (including donating it to a
political party if they want to).

Making political parties taxpayer-funded won't make politicians immune
from accusations of bribery- people who want to seek influence just
need to be more subtle, funding party-affiliated organisations or
events (this happens extensively now) and bribing politicians
personally rather than improperly funding their parties.
