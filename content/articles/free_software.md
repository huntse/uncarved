*Note*: I think all of this software is now lost

* [slidentd][5] - the sly ident daemon
* [honest_identd][6] - The slidentd package also includes this if you
want a simple identd that gives up usernames
* [aed][7] - The additional entropy daemon
* [sw][8] - A tiny ssl wrapper (similar to stunnel). I use it to
provide ssl-enabled services.
* [dnslogmunge][9] - A small perl script for decoding djbjdns logfiles
* [unaligned.c][10] - A small wrapper for debugging unaligned traps on
risc machines. Used by folks at compaq (when they produced Alphas)
and some linux folks at IBM. In fact I gave IBM a slightly better
version of this but I can't find it at the minute.
* [ching.py][11] - A small python module which can be used to generate
hexagrams of the I Ching
* [uncarved-helpers][12] - A collection of scala classes, including a
nice web client, a log4j thingymabobber and a memoization
watchamacallit.
