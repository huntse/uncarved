I trained to postgraduate level as a Jazz bass player, but worked as a
programmer to pay for my music postgrad and somehow ended up in a
career in computer science. After various roles as a permanent employee
and contractor I became the IT director of a dot com company. I then joined
Goldman Sachs because the role I was offered sounded very interesting.  I
stayed there for 8 years, working initially on infrastructure for distributed
pricing and risk, then in what would now be called devops, and then on a number
of different trading desks. It was indeed a formative experience and I learned
a lot although it was very challenging at times.

I eventually left GS and joined Palantir Technologies, a silicon valley
software company that focusses on data analysis. Palantir attracts a lot of
attention from conspiracy theorists due to work they believe it does for the US
government however I worked on the commercial side, focussing on detecting
rogue traders. This led to a joint venture they formed with Credit Suisse,
called Signac, which I was fortunate enough to be co-head of. Unfortunately due
to changes in the regulatory landscape the founding rationale for this
startup went away and Credit Suisse and Palantir decided to dissolve this
partnership.

I then joined OakNorth as the CIO of their platform business, which uses data
science, tech and credit expertise to transform lending to medium-sized and
growth businesses. It's been a very exciting journey so far.

I'm also on the panel of advisors of Antler, a hybrid incubator/vc and am an
advisor to a startup called Kamayi. I'm first author on 2 patents in the field of
fraud detection and wrote a chapter of ["The Regtech
Book"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781119362197)
published by Wiley Press along with a number of other
articles. I'm on the editorial board of the Journal of Digital Banking.

know each other. There are quite a few Sean Hunters though so I might
not be the one you're thinking of.
