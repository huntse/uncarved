I trained to postgraduate level as a Jazz bass player, but worked as a
programmer to pay for my music postgrad and somehow ended up in a
career in computer science. After various roles as a permanent employee
and contractor I became the IT director of a dot com company. I
recently left my job working for Goldman Sachs and am doing a number of
interesting side projects and a bit of IT contracting. If you have a
proposal to make to me feel free to email me at [sean@uncarved.com.][5]

You can see [my][6] linkedin profile, and invite me to your network if we
know each other. There are quite a few Sean Hunters though so I might
not be the one you're thinking of.
