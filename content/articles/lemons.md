They checked 3 times that I wanted lemon (not cucumber) in my second
$38 Hendricks and tonic even though I very obviously had lemon in my
first one. Then they brought cucumber anyway. The obscene price and the
cucumber and lemon thing are par for the course here but they are now
trying to charge me a second time for the drink I already paid for. I
give them the receipt showing I paid for that one.

Settling the bill for this drink has already taken over 10mins with
three staff squinting at the machine, my card and the receipt. And I'm
not done yet.

During the process I confirm my name twice while they stare in
amazement at my credit card. Probably not everyone has credit which
stretches to two drinks in this place.

The bar is very full. I can only assume everyone else is stuck here
still trying to settle up for drinks they bought days or even weeks
ago. Lots of people seem to have Hendricks and tonic (with cucumber)
which is a fair indication I'm onto something.

I'm deeply alone, on the last day of a business trip. My friends said
they would meet me here then all obviously ended up somewhere else.
There is no reception so we are unlikely to connect. I will not see
many of them for months. I used to love working with them, now see them
very seldom and the thought fills me with a profound sense of sadness.

One bar person comes over to explain the confusion. "You had 2
Hendricks and tonic, one with lemon and one with cucumber."

I finish my drink, get my coat and head out into the cold.
