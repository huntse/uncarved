This server is a co-located Linux box, and is brought to me (and you)
courtesy of the excellent folks at [mythic-beasts.com][5]. Their service
has been exemplary so far so I would recommend them if you want cheap
tech-savvy colo or virtual serving. This server runs excellent free
Linux server software such as [djbdns][6], [qmail][7], and [lighttpd][8].
Dynamic content is produced by a [python][9] script I wrote using
[web.py][10] . If I tidy the script up enough for general consumption
I'll make it available.

The server also runs some free software of my own, such as
[slidentd][11]. I have been told that if Britney Spears wanted an ident
daemon, this is one of a long list she would ignore before just
switching on the pidentd that came with her Linux distro. My pages are
written using the [vim][12] editor, and I use a [typematrix][13] dvorak
keyboard.

*Note*: Amusingly almost all of the above has changed since I wrote the above.
I will rewrite  with my new setup.  I still use vim though.  Well ok neovim.
So that has changed too.
