This is a static website hosted on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) using S3 and
Cloudfront. The site is generated using [zola](https://www.getzola.org), which
is a very fast and no-nonsense static site generator written in rust.

I also use AWS to host DNS for my sites and use
[fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com) for mail hosting, which means mail just
works and I don't have to spend any time figuring out why it's broken or why
upstream sites aren't accepting my mail. For some time now people hosting their
own mail and dns have been at a big disadvantage due to the way in which large
network providers have chosen to conduct the war on spam.

My pages are written using the [neovim][12] editor, and I use a Planck
[ortholinear][13] dvorak keyboard.

*Note*: Amusingly almost all of the above has changed since I wrote the first
time I made this page, so I've kept the [old one](/articles/ancient-credits) around for comparison.
