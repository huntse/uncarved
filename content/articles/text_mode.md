# Being Productive in Text Mode

## If you use a Unix system well, the command line can be the ultimate
IDE.

People who I work with are often bemused by the perculiar setup I have
on my machine, which is the product of constant evolution over the last
five years or so. My setup is designed to work well for me, not to look
pretty or provide distraction. As such, it can be thought of as sort of
the opposite of desktop environments like [Gnome.][5] The other thing
about my setup is that it is designed first and foremost to be fast and
as such programs which are slow to start, slow to run or consume a lot
of memory are completely out. For this reason, over the years I have
ditched the emacs family of editors, fancy window managers and silly
meta-environments like Gnome. People who use vim tend to look
productive and slightly wired like [this,][6] whereas emacs users have
been known to look like [this.][7] I think that proves my point nicely.

I also use a text-mode web browser where I can because it is quick to
start up and makes it quick to find information. Time-wasting web
browsing of sites entirely devoid of real information I still do with a
graphical browser, however. I have found that as computers that I use
have become faster and more powerful, my desire for speed has increased
so I am even more obsessed with small, fast apps than I used to be.

The Goals of my setup are straightforward:
* Small memory footprint
* Fast
* Flexible
* Productive
* Maximise available resources (desktop area etc)

Apps I use
* Linux - Let's not kid ourselves. I'm much more productive in Linux
than I am elsewhere.
* The vim editor - As a programmer your editor is your most important
tool and vim is by far and away the best there is (for me anyway).
* The zsh shell - The zsh shell is a pretty productive environment
for me, but the jury is still out on this for me. I don't mind bash
either as long as I can use vi keybindings.
* The [ratpoison][8] window manager- The X window manager which allows
you to do away with your mouse and means you are forever liberated
from dragging and resizing and using the annoying mouse.
* Gnu screen - I'm not going to put a link to the FSF website here so
find it on google. Screen is cool though.
* Scripting languages - noone is productive on unix without being
able to write little scripts. As well as the shell, I love
scripting in Perl, sed (sometimes) and Python.
