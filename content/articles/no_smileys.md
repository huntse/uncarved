# Thank goodness for greasemonkey

## Google recently added an extremely annoying feature to google reader.
Thankfully you can decide for yourself how their website works.

Every morning I drink my coffee and read various news sites using
google [reader,][5] so I was horrified recently to see a big yellow
smiley popping up on a bunch of posts. This is some sort of
social-networking-inspired feature which allows people to say which
posts they "like", then anyone else reading that post gets a smiley to
say "6 people liked this post" or whatever.

Perhaps this is just the ticket if you're desperately insecure about
whether or not your taste in news is in tune with the mainstream of the
internets, but as someone who does not give a flying... err monkeys
about what other people think (by and large) I hate this feature. In
fact, clicking through to the google forum on this feature I find that
it turns out there are a lot of people who do not "like" reader's new
"like" feature.

Thanks to the miracle of [greasemonkey][6] I can decide for myself what
google's site looks (and works) like in my browser, and in fact Jason
Fager has already [posted][7] a greasemonkey script that removes the
offending smileys.
